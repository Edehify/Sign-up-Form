# My Sign Up Form Project

## Description

This is a front-end sign-up form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form includes styled input fields, real-time feedback using CSS pseudo-classes, and basic validation. It was created as part of my journey through web development to practice working with forms, layouts, and DOM manipulation.

## Goal and Skills

The goal of this project is to build a visually appealing and functional sign-up form that includes form field validation, a structured layout, and responsive feedback on user input. It helps me reinforce skills in layout design, input validation, and user experience fundamentals.

### Skills Demonstrated

- Creating and linking HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files  
- Building a two-column page layout using Flexbox  
- Structuring semantic form inputs (name, email, password)  
- Styling form fields using pseudo-classes like `:focus` and `:invalid`  
- Implementing basic validation using HTML5 attributes  
- Using JavaScript to validate password match logic  
- Applying design aesthetics such as background images and custom fonts  
- Strengthening Git workflow and version control habits
